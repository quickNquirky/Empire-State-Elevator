# Empire-State-Elevator
Outstanding issues:
- Implement pre-seeded files
- Implement multiple elevators
- Add top floor setting
- Add bottom floor setting
- Add request validation
- Set up user input for real-time requests

Things I'd do if I had infinite time:
- Better error Handling
- Logging
- Even hotter scheduling (allowing hot scheduling if start floor is between elevator's current floor and it's next stop)
- Special cases: fire alarm, door shut button held
- User input cleaning
