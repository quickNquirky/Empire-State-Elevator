Design

Things I'd do if I had infinite time:
- Better error Handling
- Logging
- Even hotter scheduling (allowing hot scheduling if start floor is between elevator's current floor and it's next stop)
- Special cases: fire alarm, door shut button held
- User input cleaning
- Better way to close application
- More sofisticated routing
